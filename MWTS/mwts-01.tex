\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}
Staff scheduling in healthcare continues to be a vexing problem that consumes valuable managerial resources and whose complexity can impact the quality of care delivered and the job satisfaction of its highly skilled labor force. \cite{}

Wide range of staff scheduling problems whose details depend on the specific healthcare delivery subsystem we are talking about. Examples: recovery room nurses, floor nurses, lab technicians, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, surgical techs, ED nurses and techs, transporters.

For many systems, the kernel of the problem is a tour scheduling problem in which staffing levels needed vary both by time of day and day of week.

Introduce motivation for tactical tour scheduling problems via real projects

\section{Multi-week implicit tour scheduling model}
\label{sec-mwts}


To smooth the postpartum occupancy across days of the week, we introduce two, non-negative, dummy variables, $M^{U}$ and $M^{L}$. These are used to bound the mean occupancy across the week from above and below -- see Equation \eqref{eqn:sandwich}. Then we minimize the difference between the bounds.
\newpage
\nipar {\bf Model:} OB-SMOOTH
\nipar
\nipar Minimize
\begin{gather}
M^{U} - M^{L} \label{eqn:obj} 
\end{gather}
Subject to
\begin{gather}
0 \leq M^{L} \leq \mu_{i,j}^{4} \leq M^{U} \quad \text{($i=1,2,\ldots P$, $j=1,2,\ldots 7$)} \label{eqn:sandwich} \\ 
L_{i,j}^{a} \leq \Lambda_{i,j}^{a} \leq U_{i,j}^{a} \quad \text{($a=5,6, i=1,2,\ldots P$, $j=1,2,\ldots 7$)} \label{eqn:schedbin} \\
L_{.,j}^{a} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{P}\Lambda_{i,j}^{a} \leq U_{.,j}^{a} \quad \text{($a=5,6$, $j=1,2,\ldots 7$)} \label{eqn:schedday} \\
L^{a} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{P}\sum_{j=1}^{7}\Lambda_{i,j}^{a} \leq U^{a} \quad \text{($a=5,6$)} \label{eqn:schedweek} \\ 
\text{Equations \eqref{eqn:arrrate1}-\eqref{eqn:arrrate11} for arrival rates }  \\
\text{Equation \eqref{eqn:discharge} for discharge rates}  \\
\text{Equation \eqref{eqn:flowcons} for conservation of flow}  \\
\text{Equation \eqref{eqn:meanocc} for mean occupancy} \\
\text{Equations \eqref{eqn:varocc2}-\eqref{eqn:varocc1} for variance of occupancy }  \\
\Lambda_{i,j}^{a} \geq 0 \text{ and integer}, \quad \text{($a=5,6, i=1,2,\ldots P$, $j=1,2,\ldots 7)$} \label{eqn:schedint}
\end{gather} 

Equation \eqref{eqn:schedbin} sets upper and lower bounds on the number of scheduled inductions and scheduled cesareans by time period of day and day of week. Equations \eqref{eqn:schedday} and \eqref{eqn:schedweek} set upper and lower bounds on the number of scheduled inductions and scheduled cesareans by day of week and for the entire week, respectively. The remaining constraints constitute the patient flow portion of the model. Note that the only decision variables are $\Lambda_{i,j}^{5}$, the number of scheduled inductions, and $\Lambda_{i,j}^{6}$, the number of scheduled cesareans. The model OB-SMOOTH is a standard mixed integer linear program. 


\subsection{Computational experiments}
\label{sec-computational}

Solve realistic problems. No competitive models to which to compare to other than reporting the size of comparable explicit tour scheduling models. I guess I could compare to the 5/7 model for the restricted environment for which it was designed.
