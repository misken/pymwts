      "For years I've worked on various staff scheduling problems that arise in healthcare institutions. At their core, many such problems can be modeled as a type of optimizaiton problem called a *tour scheduling* problem. Generally speaking, a *tour* specifies a set of days worked along with a set of shifts worked on those days over some scheduling horizon. For example, for a one week horizon (let Sunday be day 1) and if every person must work 5 out of the 7 days, one tour might look **[Off,8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,Off]**. Another might look like this: **[8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,8:00a-4:00p,Off,Off]**. In what I call *tactical tour scheduling* models, there are variables in these models which represent the number of people working each allowable tour. ..."
