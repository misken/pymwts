Getting width > 0 working
-------------------------

Start by reviewing all related params and constraints in Phase 1 model
to see which were bypassed just to get width=0 working.

mwts05_d02_t1_a01_ptub_moderate_w2

RuntimeError: Failed to set value for param=A_wkend_days, index=(1, 6,
        1, 1, 2), value=0.
    	source error message="Index '(1, 6, 1, 1, 2)' is not valid for indexed
    	component 'A_wkend_days'"




Bounds on days and periods per week by shift length
---------------------------------------------------


In mix file, we have:

# The following 8 params are only needed when more than one shift
    # length is allowed for the tour type. 
    
    min_days_week: [2,2,2,2]
    max_days_week: [5,5,5,5]
    
    min_cumul_days_week: [2,4,6,8]
    max_cumul_days_week: [5,10,15,20]
    
    min_prds_week: [16,16,16,16]
    max_prds_week: [70,70,70,70]
    
    min_cumul_prds_week: [16,32,48,64]
    max_cumul_prds_week: [70,140,210,280]
    
Makes sense but how does Phase1 model compute these params for tour types with only one shift length?

  - happens in mwts_makedat.py
  - mix_days_prds_params()
