Input files and parameters

Overview of model inputs
========================

A number of input files and parameters are needed to instantiate an
instance of a scheduling model. We have provided sample AMPL DAT files
that contain detailed comments describing each of the data input sections.
The files can be found in the `examples/inputs` folder of the
pymwts project.

There are some DAT file generation procedures in `pymwtsio/` but these
are not fully documented nor complete enough for general use.
