The solution process
===============================================

A high level sequence of steps that happen when using pymwts is:

* run pymwts and specify the Phase 1 DAT file to instantiate model, the solver and solver parameters, and the output directory
* Phase 1 problem instance is generated by Pyomo
* Phase 1 problem instance is solved by specified MIP solver
* Phase 1 summary files are written
* Phase 2 DAT file is automatically created from Phase 1 solution file
* Phase 2 problem instance is generated by Pyomo
* Phase 2 problem instance is solved by specified MIP solver
* Phase 2 summary files and the tour schedule are written to the specified output directory

You can see this in action by viewing the example Jupyter notebook in the ``examples/`` folder.
