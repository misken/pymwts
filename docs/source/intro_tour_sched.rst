Intro to tour scheduling problems
===============================================

The basic idea behind implicit tour scheduling models is to
avoid the explosion in problem size that results from explicitly
representing each feasible tour by its own variable. Instead, tours are implicitly modeled with sets of *building block variables* which are coordinated with constraints in such a way that feasible tours can be constructed in a post-processing phase operating on the solution to the implicit model.

For now, see the `preprint of our paper (COMING SOON) <>`_ for all of the details on implicit modeling.
