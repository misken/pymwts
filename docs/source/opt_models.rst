The scheduling optimization models
===============================================

There are two optimization models used in our implicit tour
scheduling approach. The phase 1 model is the main implicit
model. The phase 2 model is a simple post-processor that
constructs tour schedules from the solution to the phase 1 model.
The phase 1 model ensures that feasible tours can be constructed
in phase 2.
