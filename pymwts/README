Overview of pymts src and related files
=======================================

To Do
=====

Currently it seems that I need to run the solvemwts.py from scripts that live in 
main src directory for the models. 

Files
=====

mwts.py
-------
Provides a command line interface to solvemwts procedure. User can specify inputs 
such as scenario, phase 1 dat file, output path, solver, mipgap, debug mode,
phase 1 model, and phase 2 model. It appears that there were plans to have
the ability to read a YAML formatted input config file - not implemented yet.




mwts_phase1.py
--------------

Main Phase 1 model written in Pyomo
