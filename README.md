pymtws - A multi-week implicit tour scheduling model
====================================================

This project currently contains:

* Link to preprint version of the journal paper presenting this model,
* Python code for Pyomo based scheduling models,
* Sample input and output data files,
* A Jupyter notebook containing a short demo of installing and using pymwts.

In the future we will add:

* Python code for data input and data output processing and management,
* Documentation including user manual, tutorials, explanations.

The models are mixed integer programming models, represented with the
Pyomo modeling language (a Python library) and solvable with standard
solvers such as cbc, GLPK, Gurobi, or CPLEX.
