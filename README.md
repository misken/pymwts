pymtws - A multi-week implicit tour scheduling model
====================================================

This project will contain:

* Python code for Pyomo based scheduling models
* Python code for data input and data output processing and management
* Documentation including user manual, tutorials, explanations
* Sample input and output data files

The models are mixed integer programming models, represented with the
Pyomo modeling language (a Python library) and solvable with standard
solvers such as cbc, GLPK, Gurobi, or CPLEX.
